# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Legal Research Assistant on Streamlit Cloud without the telemetry errors you were experiencing.

## Issues Fixed

1. **ChromaDB Telemetry Errors**: Fixed the `capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given` error
2. **Version Compatibility**: Resolved package version conflicts
3. **Streamlit Configuration**: Optimized settings for cloud deployment

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub repository with your project
2. A Streamlit Cloud account (free tier available)
3. API keys for your AI providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, etc.)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Make sure your repository has the following structure:
```
legal-research-assistant/
├── app.py                    # Main entry point
├── requirements-streamlit.txt # Streamlit Cloud requirements
├── .streamlit/
│   └── config.toml          # Streamlit configuration
├── src/                      # Source code
├── config/                   # Configuration files
└── data/                     # Data directory (will be created)
```

### 2. Update Your Repository

1. Commit and push all the changes we made:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix ChromaDB telemetry issues and optimize for Streamlit Cloud"
   git push origin main
   ```

### 3. Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New app"
4. Configure your app:
   - **Repository**: Select your `legal-research-assistant` repository
   - **Branch**: `main` (or your default branch)
   - **Main file path**: `app.py`
   - **App URL**: Choose a custom subdomain (optional)

### 4. Environment Variables

In Streamlit Cloud, add these environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key
- `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY`: `False`
- `CHROMA_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`: `0`

### 5. Deploy

Click "Deploy" and wait for the build to complete.

## What We Fixed

### ChromaDB Telemetry Issues

The main problem was that newer versions of ChromaDB changed the `capture()` method signature, causing the telemetry errors. We fixed this by:

1. **Pinning ChromaDB version** to `0.4.22` (stable version)
2. **Completely disabling telemetry** at multiple levels
3. **Monkey-patching** the telemetry methods to prevent errors
4. **Environment variable overrides** for all telemetry settings

### Package Version Conflicts

We resolved version conflicts by:
1. **Pinning exact versions** instead of using ranges
2. **Using compatible versions** of all packages
3. **Creating a separate requirements file** for Streamlit Cloud

### Streamlit Configuration

We optimized the Streamlit configuration for cloud deployment:
1. **Disabled telemetry and analytics**
2. **Configured server settings** for cloud environments
3. **Optimized memory usage** and file upload limits

## Troubleshooting

### If You Still See Telemetry Errors

1. Check that you're using `requirements-streamlit.txt` (not `requirements.txt`)
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Clear your browser cache and restart the app

### If the App Won't Start

1. Check the Streamlit Cloud logs for specific error messages
2. Verify your API keys are correct
3. Make sure all required files are in your repository

### Performance Issues

1. The app may take a few minutes to start on first deployment
2. Document processing might be slower on the free tier
3. Consider upgrading to a paid tier for better performance

## Monitoring

After deployment:
1. **Check the logs** in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. **Monitor API usage** to avoid rate limits
3. **Test document upload** and querying functionality

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Streamlit Cloud logs first
2. Verify your repository structure matches the guide
3. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly

## Next Steps

Once deployed successfully:
1. Test all functionality thoroughly
2. Share your app URL with users
3. Monitor usage and performance
4. Consider adding more features or optimizations

Your Legal Research Assistant should now work perfectly on Streamlit Cloud without any telemetry errors!
